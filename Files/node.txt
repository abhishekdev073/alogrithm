1. JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
2. Node => v8 + libUv
3. V8(C++,JS) :- Open source javascript engine created by google. Make 
4. libUv(C++) :- open source project give access to OS,File sytem, networking : 
5. Node lib file contains the js code its called src c++ code, v8 transalte js value to c++
6. Thread :- Unit of instruction waiting to get executed
Node program run in 1 thread
7. Event Loop :- Every time event loop is run called tick
      Event loop check for condtion if its true then it run event loop
	  1. Any pending settimeout,setInterval, setImediate
      2. Any Pending OS task. ex:any server listening to any port
      3. Any pendinglong running opertaion eg: Fs module  
Event loop do
  1. Look of pending timers and any callback function
  2. Look of pending OS task and Pending opertaion node execute callback  
  3. Pause execution. Continue when
         new Pending task done
	     new pending opertaion done
	     timer is about to complete
  4. Look at pendingtimer. call any setimediate
  5. Handle any close event  . ex readStream 
8. Node event loop :- Single thread
   Some of function /std libUv:- Not a single thread. run outside of event loop
    Expensive function run out of event loop(Crypto,Fs)
    uses thread pool . create 4 thread process 4 task
9.  MutliThreading : give concurrency 
      If 1 task taking 1sec
	  then 2 task will take 2sec (depend on core) both will complete at same time
10.LibUv delegate OS:-  Https request :- LibUv delegate rquest to OS. Os send the rquest Os handle the request. Event loop is free	
   Everything around networking handle by OS  :- PendingOSTask 
   
11.Cluster mode:- Multiple copy of node running your server . multiple instance of server. MultiThreading - Reccommended
   no of server instance should be equal to number of physical or logical core
   PM2 use pm2 to handle cluster automatically
12. Worker thread: Our app <===> worker thread communicate with post message and on message
    Worker thread get executed out of event loop 
13 Redis for caching. Util.promisfy make function promise	
14 Puppeteer and jest is used for node integrated testing
15 Continues Integration (Travis) :- Code get build test and autmatically get deployed
  we do code in YAML its like JSON
16 Require module check in node modules folder to its parent and cache the path :its caches the file
17 In node we can run c++ code wiht node-gyp
18: Node is best for I/O opertaions 
    Not good for CPU Intensive processing like Image processing/video processing
19 read url value :-  /home/:name
     var name = req.params.name;
   //  var name = req.query.name;
